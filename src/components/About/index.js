        Hello, my name is Ben Vue. I am in the process of becoming a full stack web developer. 
        I am making a career change to find new challenges and learn skills to solve simple problems 
        that annoy me on the web. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I have a degree in Nutrition with a Dietetics focus, and have good communication skills
        due to my current job requiring me to. I am sure this will also transition well into my new place in the web.
